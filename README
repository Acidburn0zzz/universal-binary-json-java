Universal Binary JSON Java Library

	<Under Active Development, notes below...>


Changelog
---------
10-14-11
	* ObjectWriter rewritten and works correctly. Tested with the example test
	data and wrote out the compressed and uncompressed formats files correctly
	from their original object representation.
	
	* Added support for reading and writing huge values as BigInteger as well
	as BigDecimal.
	
	* Added automatic numeric storage compression support to ObjectWriter - based
	on the numeric value (regardless of type) the value will be stored as the
	smallest possible representation in the UBJ format if requested.
	
	* Added mapping support for BigDecimal, BigInteger, AtomicInteger and 
	AtomicLong to ObjectWriter.

10-10-11
	* com.ubjson.io AND com.ubjson.io.charset are finalized against the 
	Draft 8 specification.
	
	* The lowest level UBJInput/OuputStream classes were tightened up to run as 
	fast as possible showing an 800ns-per-op improvement in speed.
	
	* Profiled core UBJInput/OuputStream classes using HPROF for a few million
	iterations and found no memory leaks and no performance traps; everything at
	that low level is as tight as it can be.
	
	* Stream-parsing facilities were moved out of the overloaded UBJInputStream
	class and into their own subclass called UBJInputStreamParser which operates
	exactly like a pull-parsing scenario (calling nextType then switching on the
	value and pulling the appropriate value out of the stream).
	
	* More example testing/benchmarking data checked into /test/java/com/ubjson/data
	
	Will begin reworking the Reflection based Object mapping in the 
	org.ubjson.reflect package now that the core IO classes are finalized.
	
	* Removed all old scratch test files from the org.ubjson package, this was
	confusing.

	* Initial check-in of core IO classes to read/write spec.
