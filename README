Universal Binary JSON Java Library
http://ubjson.org


	<Actively under development, but the core I/O classes needed to read/write
	the spec are in the repo now>


Changelog
---------
10-10-11
	* com.ubjson.io AND com.ubjson.io.charset are finalized against the 
	Draft 8 specification. 
	
	* The lowest level UBJInput/OuputStream classes were tightened up to run as 
	fast as possible showing an 800ns-per-op improvement in speed.
	
	* Stream-parsing facilities were moved out of the overloaded UBJInputStream
	class and into their own subclass called UBJInputStreamParser which operates
	exactly like a pull-parsing scenario (calling nextType then switching on the
	value and pulling the appropriate value out of the stream).
	
	* More example testing/benchmarking data checked into /test/java/com/ubjson/data
	
	Will begin reworking the Reflection based Object mapping in the 
	org.ubjson.reflect package now that the core IO classes are finalized.

	* Initial check-in of core IO classes to read/write spec.
